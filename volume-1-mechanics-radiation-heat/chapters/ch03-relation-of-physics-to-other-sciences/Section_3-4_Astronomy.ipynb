    "### 1. How do we know? (Spectroscopy)\n",
    "- **The Problem:** We can't go there to take a sample. The eye just mixes colors together.\n",
    "- **The Solution:** A spectroscope splits light into its component frequencies.\n",
    "- **The Analogy:** It's like listening to an orchestra. Your ear can pick out the trumpet from the violin (timbre). The spectroscope picks out Hydrogen from Helium.\n",
    "- **Fun Fact:** Helium was discovered on the Sun (Helios) *before* it was found on Earth!"
