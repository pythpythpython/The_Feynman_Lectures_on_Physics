# The Feynman Lectures on Physics - Study Repository

A comprehensive study repository for [The Feynman Lectures on Physics](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/) - one of the most renowned physics lecture series ever created.

## 📚 About

This repository is organized to support structured study of Richard Feynman's legendary physics lectures delivered at Caltech from 1961-1963. The structure mirrors the resources available on the official Feynman Lectures website, with dedicated spaces for notes, code implementations, and exercises.
