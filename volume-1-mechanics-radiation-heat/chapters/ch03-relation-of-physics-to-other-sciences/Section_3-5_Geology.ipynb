    "- **Instability:** The air is swirling and twisting. It is a system of **Turbulent Flow**.\n",
    "- **The Dam Analogy:** Water flows smoothly over a dam, but then breaks into chaotic blobs and drops. We cannot predict exactly where a specific drop will form. The same applies to air swirling over a mountain."
