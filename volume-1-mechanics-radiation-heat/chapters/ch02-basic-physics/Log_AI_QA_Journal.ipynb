    "## 🧠 Key Concept: The \"Why\" of Quantum Mechanics\n",
    "**Question:** *Why exactly does the uncertainty principle prevent the atom from collapsing?*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "- In classical physics, an electron spirals into the nucleus because it radiates energy.\n",
    "- In quantum physics, \"falling in\" means $\\Delta x$ (position uncertainty) gets very small.\n",
    "- The law $\\Delta x \\Delta p \\geq \\hbar/2$ demands that as $\\Delta x \\to 0$, $\\Delta p \\to \\infty$.\n",
    "- High momentum variability means high **Kinetic Energy**.\n",
    "- Therefore, squeezing an electron into a nucleus requires giving it infinite energy. It refuses to go! It finds a stable orbit where the electrical pull balances this \"quantum refusal\" to be confined."

    "## 🧠 Key Concept: The Strong Force\n",
    "**Question:** *If protons repel each other, why doesn't the nucleus explode?*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "- There is a third force involved: The **Strong Nuclear Force**.\n",
    "- It is much stronger than electricity, but only at short range ($10^{-15}$ m).\n",
    "- It acts like \"nuclear glue\" for protons and neutrons."

    "## 🧠 Key Concept: Fields vs. Particles\n",
    "**Question:** *Is light a wave or a particle?*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "- It is **both** (and neither). It is a quantum field excitation.\n",
    "- At low frequencies (Radio), it behaves like a classical wave.\n",
    "- At high frequencies (Gamma rays), it behaves like a bullet (particle).\n",
    "- Quantum mechanics unifies these views."
