    "- **Space/time changed:** After 1920, Einstein unified space & time (special relativity), then curved space-time for gravity (general relativity).\n",
    "- **Newton’s laws fail at small scales:** On the atomic scale, ideas like position, speed, and force are replaced with quantum laws that defy our everyday intuition.\n",
    "- **Key point:** Small-scale physics is “unnatural”—there’s nothing in daily experience like it, and it’s best described mathematically, not pictorially."

    "- **No definite position *and* speed:** The quantum rule: $\\Delta x \\Delta p \\geq \\hbar/2$\n",
    "- **Why atoms don’t collapse:** If electrons could sit right on the nucleus, their position would be certain—their momentum, wildly uncertain and correspondingly huge, would launch them away. They “compromise” by clouding around the nucleus.\n",
    "- Even at absolute zero, all matter still “jitters” because you can’t know position and velocity exactly at once!"
