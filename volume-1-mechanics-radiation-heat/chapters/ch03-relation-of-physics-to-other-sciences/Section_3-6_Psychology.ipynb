    "Feynman approaches psychology with a physicist's skepticism and curiosity. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Psychoanalysis is not Science\n",
    "Feynman is famously blunt here:\n",
    "> *\"Psychoanalysis is not a science: it is at best a medical process, and perhaps even more like witch-doctoring.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?** \n",
    "- Not because it doesn't help people (witch doctors help people too!).\n",
    "- But because it lacks **experimental verification**. It has theories (spirits/id/ego), but no controlled data on what works and what doesn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The Physical Basis of Memory\n",
    "The central scientific problem of psychology/neuroscience is:\n",
    "> *\"When an animal learns something... its brain cell must have changed too, if it is made out of atoms. In what way is it different?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The Atom of Thought:** If you memorize a phone number, *something* physical in your brain structure must change. Is it a chemical? A connection growing? \n",
    "- **Current Status:** In the 1960s, this was a total mystery. Today, we know about **synaptic plasticity** (connections getting stronger), but the full \"code\" of memory is still unsolved."

    "### 3. Brains vs. Computers\n",
    "Feynman touches on the analogy between the brain's \"interconnecting wires\" and computing machines.\n",
    "- **Complexity:** The brain is so massive that we cannot analyze it wire-by-wire.\n",
    "- **The Dog Problem:** We are nowhere near understanding humans. *\"If we could even figure out how a dog works, we would have gone pretty far.\"*\n",
    "- **Reductionism Limit:** Even if we know how a synapse works (physics), predicting human behavior (psychology) is like predicting the weather—too complex."
