    "- **We do not know the rules, only the moves**.\n",
    "- We *guess* rules and check them by observation and experiment.\n",
    "- Sometimes, strange new moves (like castling in chess) force us to change our rules—just as quantum mechanics changed classical physics.\n",
    "- Physics focuses on the **rules of the game** (the laws), not always on why a particular move is made (complex phenomena).\n"

    "1. **Complete Analysis:** Sometimes the ‘board’ is simple enough that we can check every move against our rules (analyzable experiments).\n",
    "2. **Derivative Constraints:** We can’t see every step, but there are general consequences (like a bishop always being on red squares). We can check these summary predictions.\n",
    "3. **Approximate Understanding:** Even if we can’t see every detail, we can often check that the big picture matches our expectations (the king is being protected)."
