    "\n",
    "### 1. Process vs. History\n",
    "- **Physics:** Typically asks \"How does it work?\" (Process). We don't ask how the laws of gravity *evolved*; we assume they are timeless.\n",
    "- **Biology/Geology/Astronomy:** Ask \"How did it get here?\" (History). Evolution, Mountain formation, Stellar birth.\n",
    "- **The Convergence:** If we ever find that physical laws *do* change over time, then physics will become a historical science too."
