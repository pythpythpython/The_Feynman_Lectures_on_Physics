    "- **The Periodic Table:** Mendeleev organized the elements by their properties (rules of combination). \n",
    "- **The Explanation:** Quantum Mechanics later explained *why* these rules exist. The electron shells and energy levels determines how atoms bond.\n",
    "- **The Limitation:** \"We have knowledge of the rules, but we cannot play very well.\" \n",
    "  - We can write the Schrödinger equation for any molecule.\n",
    "  - We can *solve* it precisely only for the simplest ones (like Hydrogen).\n",
    "  - For complex molecules, the math is too hard, so we still need experimental chemistry."

    "- **No Vital Force:** Organic molecules are made of the *exact same atoms* as inorganic ones, following the *exact same physical laws*.\n",
    "- **Complexity:** The only difference is the arrangement. Organic molecules are larger and more complex.\n",
