    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "- The equations (Navier-Stokes) are **non-linear**. \n",
    "- This means small changes in the input (a tiny bump in the water) can create massive changes in the output (a giant whirlpool).\n",
    "- This sensitivity makes \"exact solutions\" mathematically impossible for most real-world cases."
