    "- **Space and Time:** Physics takes place in 3D space (Euclid) and time.\n",
    "- **Particles:** \"Things\" are particles—atoms with inertia. If moving, they keep moving unless a force acts.\n",
    "- **Forces:** Two main types before 1920:\n",
    "  - **Short-range forces:** e.g. holding atoms in molecules/solids (complex, chemical)\n",
    "  - **Long-range force:** Gravity ($F \\propto 1/r^2$), simple but whose *why* was unknown.\n",
    "- **Matter:** Everything is made of moving particles; gas pressure is collisions, wind is net flow, heat is atomic motion, sound is density waves.\n"

    "- Atoms were pictured as a **massive, positive nucleus** (later known to have protons & neutrons) surrounded by light, negative electrons."

    "- **Gravity:** Weak, always attractive, acts at all distances.\n",
    "- **Electricity:** Much, much stronger, with two types of charge:\n",
    "  - *Plusses repel, minuses repel, but plus-minus attract.*\n",
    "- Most atoms are neutral overall, so at large distances, electrical forces nearly cancel.\n",
    "- If you rub off a few negatives or positives, strong electric forces appear—which is the source of static electricity phenomena.\n",
    "- *Example:* If two grains of sand had a single charge each and were 30 meters apart, the force would be millions of tons if not cancelled!"
