    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Phase 1: Foundation (Section 1-1)\n",
    "- **Goal:** Establish the core concept (\"The Atomic Hypothesis\").\n",
    "- **Actions:**\n",
    "  - Created `Section_1-1_Introduction.ipynb`: Detailed breakdown of Feynman's \"One Sentence.\"\n",
    "  - Generated `section_1_1_deep_dive.md`: An external analysis of the hypothesis (now migrated below).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Phase 2: Expansion (Sections 1-2 to 1-4)\n",
    "- **Goal:** Cover the full breadth of the chapter content.\n",
    "- **Actions:**\n",
    "  - Generated `Section_1-2_Matter_is_Made_of_Atoms.ipynb`: Notes on solids, liquids, gases, and lattice structures.\n",
    "  - Generated `Section_1-3_Atomic_Processes.ipynb`: Notes on evaporation, cooling, and pressure.\n",
    "  - Generated `Section_1-4_Chemical_Reactions.ipynb`: Notes on burning, biology, and molecular partners.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Phase 3: The \"Laboratory\" (Activities)\n",
    "- **Goal:** Make the physics interactive.\n",
    "- **Actions:**\n",
    "  - Created `Activity_Interactive_Playground.ipynb` (formerly `02-examples-and-code`): Python simulations for Brownian motion and temperature kinetics.\n",
    "  - Created `Activity_Flashcards.ipynb` (formerly `06-flashcards`): An `ipywidgets`-based active recall deck.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Phase 4: Restructuring & Optimization\n",
    "- **Goal:** Clean up the file system for clarity and ease of use.\n",
    "- **Actions:**\n",
    "  - **Renaming:** Converted numbered files (e.g., `04-reading-notes`) to descriptive names (e.g., `Section_1-4_Chemical_Reactions`).\n",
    "  - **Consolidation:** Deleted scattered exercise files (`03-exercises-in-progress`, `04-solutions`) and merged them into a single `Activity_Exercise_Bank.ipynb` with toggleable solutions.\n",
    "  - **Dashboarding:** Created `Overview_Master_Dashboard.ipynb` as the central navigation hub."

    "2.  **Dynamics:** Nothing is static; heat is motion.\n",
    "3.  **Interaction:** The force law (Attract far, Repel close) explains everything from elasticity to chemical bonding."

    "**Question:** Why does blowing on hot soup cool it down?\n",
    "\n",
    "**AI Explanation:**\n",
    "1.  **Temperature = Average Energy:** In the soup, molecules have a distribution of speeds. Some are fast, some are slow.\n",
    "2.  **Escape:** Only the very fastest molecules have enough energy to break the surface tension and escape into the air.\n",
    "3.  **Selection Bias:** When the fastest ones leave, the average energy of the *remaining* molecules drops. Thus, the liquid cools.\n",
    "4.  **The Role of Blowing:** Normally, the escaping vapor hangs around the surface and some bounce back in. Blowing removes this vapor layer, preventing re-entry and maximizing the net loss of \"hot\" molecules."

    "\n",
    "**AI Explanation:**\n",
    "They *are* moving (vibrating), but they are trapped in a \"potential well.\" Imagine a dog on a short leash. It can run around (vibrate), but it can't leave the yard (lattice site). In a liquid, the leash is broken, but the yard is still crowded—the atoms slide past each other but stay close."
