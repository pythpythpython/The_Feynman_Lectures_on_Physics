    "### 1. Operational Definitions\n",
    "Physics doesn't ask \"What *is* time?\" Instead, it asks \"How do we *measure* time?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The Measurement Cascade\n",
    "Each technique extends our reach:\n",
    "- Day → Hour → Second → Nanosecond → Femtosecond\n",
    "- Meter → Micron → Atom → Nucleus → Quark\n",

    "### 3. Multiple Definitions That Agree\n",
    "Distance can be measured by:\n",
    "- Counting with a stick\n",
    "- Triangulation\n",
    "- Radar time-of-flight\n",
    "- Color-brightness inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Where they overlap, they agree—suggesting they measure the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Fundamental Limits\n",
    "Nature itself prevents perfect measurement:\n",
    "- Δx·Δp ≥ ℏ/2 (position-momentum)\n",
    "- Δt·ΔE ≥ ℏ/2 (time-energy)\n",
    "\n",
    "This isn't about bad instruments—it's about the wave nature of matter."
